Minimalist Web Notepad
======================

This is an open source clone of notepad.cc, which is now defunct.

For a demo, see https://orga.cat/notes or https://orga.cat/notes/whatever.


Installation
------------

At the top of `index.php` file, change `$base_url` variable to point to your
site.

Make sure the web server is allowed to write to the `_tmp` directory.

### On Apache

You may need to enable mod_rewrite and set up `.htaccess` files in your site configuration.
See [How To Set Up mod_rewrite for Apache](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-mod_rewrite-for-apache-on-ubuntu-14-04).

### On Nginx

To enable URL rewriting, put something like this in your configuration file:

```
location ~* ^/notes/(\w+)$ {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /notes/index.php?f=$1;
}
```
